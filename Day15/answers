1) print()

2) In python integers store a whole number
   for example: age = 14
   type(age) will be int

3) We use strings to store texts
   for example: name = Alex
   type(name) will be str

4) 10 + 5 * 2 = 20
   since we do the multiplication first, we multiply 5 to 2 and get 10, after that we add 10 to itself and get to the answer 20.

5) answer = 42

6) We use the term "debugging" when identifying and fixing errors.

7) Snake case is a convention that underscores separate words, such as "hello_world"

8) Comments help other developers understand code better.

9) input()

10) We had to choose the correct one from 4 answers. The answer was array.

11) type()

12) for example:
    age_int = 14
    age_str = str(age_int)
    type(age_str) will give us the type of this variable which is going to be string.

13) We use the term "Conversion" when we convert one data type into another.

14) we use the " == " to check if two values are equal in python.

15) result1 = True and True  # True
    result2 = True and False  # False
    result3 = False and True  # False
    result4 = False and False  # False
    
    result5 = True or True  # True
    result6 = True or False  # True
    result7 = False or True  # True
    result8 = False or False  # False
    
    which means that True and False operation will result in False.

16) (5 > 3) and (10 < 20)
    Since 5 > 3 and 10 < 20 are both correct, this is True and True operation which will result in True 

17) if statement makes decisions and executes different code blocks based on conditions.

18) for loop is used to iterate over a sequence.

19) while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as the condition is true.

20) The range() function returns a sequence of numbers.

21) to start an if statement we use the "if" keyword.

22) The statement "else" provides an another way for code to be executed if the condition is false.

23) We use the list type of data to store an ordered collections of items.

24) The first element of a sequence is represented by 0.
    for example:
    my_list = [1,32,45,2,4]
    my_list[0]

25) The third element is represented by 2.
    for example:
    my_list = [1,32,45,2,4]
    my_list[2]

26) slicing allows us to extract a portion from the list.

27) list[2:6]

28) the step between elements is called the "step"

29) Reusable block of code in python that performs a specific task is called functions.

30) Value passed to a function is called an argument.

31) upper()

32) append()

33) keyword def is used to define a new function.

34) keyword return is used to return a value from a function.
