        <h2>Who Was Napoleon?</h2>
        <pre style="font-size: larger;">
   Napoleon I, also called Napoléon Bonaparte, was a French military general and statesman.
Napoleon played a key role in the French Revolution (1789–99), served as first consul of France (1799–1804), and was the first emperor of France (1804–14/15).
Today Napoleon is widely considered one of the greatest military generals in history.

        <h2>Founding the Empire</h2>
        <pre style="font-size:larger"> The peace settlement had brought about the life consulate; the return of war was to stimulate the formation of the empire.
The British government, which would have been glad to see Bonaparte deposed or removed by assassination, renewed its subsidies to the French royalists, who resumed their agitation and plotting.
When a British-financed assassination plot was uncovered in 1804, Bonaparte decided to react vigorously enough to deter his opponents from any more such attempts.
The police believed that the real head of the conspiracy was the young duc d’Enghien, a scion of the royal house of Bourbon, who was residing in Germany, a few miles across the frontier.
Accordingly, with the agreement of Talleyrand and the police chief Joseph Fouché, the duke was kidnapped on neutral soil and brought to Vincennes, where he was tried and shot (March 21).
This action provoked a resurgence of opposition among the old aristocracy but enhanced the influence of Fouché.

        <h2>Downfall and abdication of Napoleon I</h2>
        <pre style="font-size:larger">
   In January 1814 France was being attacked on all its frontiers. The allies cleverly announced that they were fighting not against the French people but against Napoleon alone,
since in November 1813 he had rejected the terms offered by the Austrian foreign minister Klemens, Fürst (prince) von Metternich, which would have preserved the natural frontiers of France.
The extraordinary strategic feats achieved by the emperor during the first three months of 1814 with the army of young conscripts were not enough; he could neither defeat the allies,
with their overwhelming numerical superiority, nor arouse the majority of the French people from their resentful torpor. The Legislative Assembly and the Senate, formerly so docile,
were now asking for peace and for civil and political liberties. By the Treaty of Chaumont of March 1814, Austria, Russia, and Great Britain bound themselves together for 20 years,
undertook not to negotiate separately, and promised to continue the struggle until Napoleon was overthrown. When the allied armies arrived before Paris on March 30, Napoleon had moved east to attack their rear guard.
The Parisian authorities, no longer overawed by the emperor, lost no time in treating with the allies. As president of the provisional government, Talleyrand proclaimed the deposition of the emperor
and, without consulting the French people, began to negotiate with Louis XVIII, the brother of the executed Louis XVI. Napoleon had only reached Fontainebleau when he heard that Paris had capitulated.
Persuaded that further resistance was useless, he finally abdicated on April 6. By the Treaty of Fontainebleau, the allies granted him the island of Elba as a sovereign principality,
an annual income of two million francs to be provided by France, and a guard of 400 volunteers. Also he retained the title of emperor. After unsuccessfully trying to poison himself,
Napoleon spoke his farewell to his “Old Guard,” and after a hazardous journey, during which he narrowly escaped assassination, he arrived at Elba on May 4.
